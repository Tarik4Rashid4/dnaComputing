# Evolutionary-DNA-Computing-Algorithm
The research work aims at offering a simulated evolutionary DNA computing model which incorporates DNA computing with an evolutionary algorithm. This evolutionary approach provides the likelihood for increasing dimensionality through replacing the typical filtering method by an evolutionary one. Thus, via iteratively increasing and recombination a population of strands, eliminating incorrect solutions from the population, and choosing the best solutions via gel electrophoresis, an optimal or near-optimal solution can be evolved rather than extracted from the initial population.
